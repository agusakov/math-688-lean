## Definitions:
* A sequence of nonnegative integers is called `graphic` if it is the degree
  sequence of a simple graph.

how does one write dn where n is a subscript?

Havel-Hakimi Theorem: Let d_1 ≥ d_2 ≥ ... ≥ d_n ≥ 0 be a (finite) sequence of 
nonnegative integers. The sequence is graphic iff the sequence 
  d_2 - 1, ... , d_(t + 1) - 1, d_(t + 2), ... , d_n, where t = d_1, is graphic.


Let 0 ≤ d_1 ≤ d_2 ≤ ... ≤ d_n be a (finite) sequence of 
nonnegative integers. The sequence is graphic iff the sequence 
  d_2 - 1, ... , d_(t + 1) - 1, d_(t + 2), ... , d_n, where t = d_1 is graphic.

/-
Let `S = (d_{1},\dots ,d_{n})` be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is nonincreasing. 
List `S` is graphic if and only if the finite list `S' = (d_{2}-1,d_{3}-1,\dots ,d_{{d_{1}+1}}-1,d_{{d_{1}+2}},\dots ,d_{n})` 
has nonnegative integers and is graphic.
