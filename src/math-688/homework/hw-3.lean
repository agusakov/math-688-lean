1. Let `A` be a real and symmetric `n × n` matrix. For each eigenvalue `θ` of `A`,
  let `Uθ` be a matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace
  corresponding to `θ` and denote `Eθ = Uθ * Uθᵀ`. The matrices `Eθ` are called
  the principal idempotents of `A`. The set of (distinct) eigenvalues of `A` is 
  denoted by `ev(A)`.

2. Let `G` be an undirected simple graph on n vertices with adjacency matrix
  `A` whose eigenvalues are `λ1, λ2, ..., λn`. Let `H` be the graph obtained 
  from `G` by removing vertex `1`.
